Find largest distance
Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes. The goal of the problem is to find largest 
distance between two nodes in a tree. Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the nodes (there will be a 
unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree). The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.

The tree is given as an array P, there is an edge between nodes P[i] and i (0 <= i < N). Exactly one of the iâ€™s will have P[i] equal 
to -1, it will be root node.

 Example:
If given P is [-1, 0, 0, 0, 3], then node 0 is the root and the whole tree looks like this: 
          0
       /  |  \
      1   2   3
               \
                4  
 One of the longest path is 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 and its length is 3, thus the answer is 3.
