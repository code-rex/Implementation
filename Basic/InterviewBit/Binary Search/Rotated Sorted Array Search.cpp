/*
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7  might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 ).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array, return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Input : [4 5 6 7 0 1 2] and target = 4
Output : 0

NOTE : Think about the case when there are duplicates. Does your current solution work? How does the time complexity change?*
