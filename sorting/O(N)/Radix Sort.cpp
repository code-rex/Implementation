//Digitwise sorting(LSD to MSD). takes linear time for sorting range 1 - n^2 where counting sort will take O(n^2) time
//Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that sort in O(n+k) time when elements are in range from 1 to k.
//Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort .

//Time complexity: Let there be d digits in input integers. Radix Sort takes O(d*(n+b)) time where b is the base for representing numbers, 
//for example, for decimal system, b is 10.
/*
1)What is the value of d? If k is the maximum possible value, then d would be O(logb(k)). So overall time complexity is O((n+b) * logb(k)).
   Which looks more than the time complexity of comparison based sorting algorithms for a large k.
2)Let us first limit k. Let k <= n^c where c is a constant. In that case, the complexity becomes O(nLogb(n)). But it still doesnâ€™t beat 
  comparison based sorting algorithms.
3)What if we make value of b larger?. What should be the value of b to make the time complexity linear? If we set b as n, we get the 
   time complexity as O(n). In other words, we can sort an array of integers with range from 1 to nc if the numbers are represented in 
   base n (or every digit takes log2(n) bits).
*/

/*
Is Radix Sort preferable to Comparison based sorting algorithms like Quick-Sort?
If we have log2n bits for every digit, the running time of Radix appears to be better than Quick Sort for a wide range of input numbers. 
The constant factors hidden in asymptotic notation are higher for Radix Sort and Quick-Sort uses hardware caches more effectively. 
Also, Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine and counting sort takes extra space to sort numbers.
